# Architecture

The Self-Adaptive Honeypot Network consists of:
- **Authentication Layer** → Secure login with password encryption
- **Honeypot Detection** → Logs failed login attempts
- **Adaptive Response** → Changes database table IDs dynamically after repeated attacks
- **API Security** → JWT-based authentication, expiring tokens
